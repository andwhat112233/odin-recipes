    -this project seems like a simple project. I am excited to see if my assumption is correct and looking forward to any coding challenges that will come up during the creation of my food recipes project.

        Project notes:
         -realization that good planning helps save time and improves consistency, i.e. finding all the recipes and how the page layout will be before hand.
         -making notes of task helps from switching back and forth from windows
         -making the pages i know i will need ahead of time helps with organization of files
