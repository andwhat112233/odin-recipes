        <h2> Dunking Good Sandwhich </h2>
        <p> With just the right amount of crunch, melty cheddar cheese, and a couple good slices of tomato, you might even convert a tuna hater with this tuna melt recipe. The key to this sandwich is that the tuna salad is not your bog-standard, bland tuna salad. We packed this sandwich full of celery, pickles, red onion, and pepper flakes to make a flavorful salad that eats just as good by itself as it does in this sandwich. </p>
        <p> My husband never loved tomato soup until he tried this Creamy Tomato Soup. The addition of parmesan and just 1/2 cup of cream makes it so satisfying. Itâ€™s also a quick and easy 30-minute soup that keeps well in the fridge. We love it all year round and whip up a batch any time we are craving the delicious tuna melts.</p>
