        <h2> Dunking Good Sandwhich </h2>
            <p> With just the right amount of crunch, melty cheddar cheese, and a couple good slices of tomato, you might even convert a tuna hater with this tuna melt recipe. The key to this sandwich is that the tuna salad is not your bog-standard, bland tuna salad. We packed this sandwich full of celery, pickles, red onion, and pepper flakes to make a flavorful salad that eats just as good by itself as it does in this sandwich. </p>
            <p> My husband never loved tomato soup until he tried this Creamy Tomato Soup. The addition of parmesan and just 1/2 cup of cream makes it so satisfying. It’s also a quick and easy 30-minute soup that keeps well in the fridge. We love it all year round and whip up a batch any time we are craving the delicious tuna melts.</p>

            <p><em> I Could Eat a Cow! </em></p>
        <h4> Tuna Melt </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 400°. In a large bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes (if using).
                    </li>
                    <li>Drain tuna then add to mayonnaise mixture. Use a fork to break up tuna into flakes. Add celery, pickles, red onion, and parsley and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>Butter one side of each bread slice. Top an unbuttered side with approximately 1/2 cup of tuna salad, 2 to 3 slices tomato, and 2 slices of cheese. Top with another slice of bread, buttered side facing up. Repeat with remaining ingredients and place on a large baking sheet. Bake until cheese is melty, 5 to 8 minutes.
                    </li>
                </ol>
        <h4> Tomato Soup </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a non-reactive pot over medium heat. Melt in 4 Tbsp butter then sautee onions until softened and golden (10-12 min). Add minced garlic and saute another minute.</li>
                    <li>Stir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with their juice, your chicken stock, chopped basil, sugar and black pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Use an immersion blender in the pot or blend in batches using a blender (be careful not to overfill the blender with hot liquid) and return soup to the pot.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the heavy cream and shredded parmesan. Return to a simmer and season to taste if needed.</li>
                    <li>Ladle into warm bowls and garnish with more parmesan and basil.</li>
                </ol>
