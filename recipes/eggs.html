            <p class="textcenter subhead"> So good, It will make you "Mhm Mhm" </p>
            <p class="textcenter"> Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast menu item, and itâ€™s super easy to make from home! It starts with a toasted english muffin, topped with a slice or two of Canadian bacon, a poached egg, and smothered in traditional Eggs Benedict sauce, called hollandaise sauce.</p>
            <p class="textcenter"> I first heard of eggs benedict when I was trying out a local resturant in my town; <a href="https://www.kekes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Keke's Breakfast Cafe</a>. I knew I had to make my own recipe for this dish. This is a staple breakfast dish at my home and at 348 calories you can eat this everyday as a healthy meal.</p>

        <h4 class="textcenter subhead">Hollandaise Sauce</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan. In a separate small bowl, beat the egg yolks. Mix in lemon juice, whipping cream, and salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Add a small spoonful of the hot melted butter to the egg mixture and stir well. Repeat this process adding a spoonful at a time of hot butter to the egg mixture.( Adding the butter slowly, a spoonful at a time, will temper the eggs and ensure they don't curdle).</li>
                    <li>Once the butter has been incorporated, pour the mixture back into the saucepan. Cook on low heat, stirring constantly, for just 20-30 seconds. Remove from heat and set aside. It will thicken as it cools. Stir well and add another splash of cream, if needed, to thin.</li>
                </ol>
        <h4 class="textcenter subhead">Poached Eggs</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fill a medium size pot with about 3 inches of water. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce heat until it reaches a simmer. You should see small bubbles coming to the surface but not rolling.  </li>
                    <li>Add a little splash of vinegar to the water (this is optional, but it helps the egg white to stay together once it is in the water).</li>
                    <li>Crack one egg into a small cup (I use a measuring cup).  Lower the egg into the simmer water, gently easing it out of the cup.</li>
                    <li>Cook the egg in simmering water for 3-5 minutes, depending on how soft you want your egg yolk. Remove the poached egg with a slotted spoon.</li>
                    <li>It is not abnormal for a white foam to form on top of the water when poaching an egg. You can simple skim the foam off of the water with a spoon.</li>
                    <li>While the egg is cooking, place the slices of Canadian bacon in a large pan and cook on medium-high heat for about 1 minute on each side.</li>
                </ol>
        <h4 class="textcenter subhead"> Assemble and <strong>EAT!</strong> </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Toast the English muffin. Top each toasted side with a slice or two of Canadian bacon, and then a poached egg. Top with hollandaise sauce.</li>
                </ol>
