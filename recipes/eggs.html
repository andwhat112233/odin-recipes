        <h2> Simple, Elegant, Delicious </h2>
        <p> Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast menu item, and itâ€™s super easy to make from home! It starts with a toasted english muffin, topped with a slice or two of Canadian bacon, a poached egg, and smothered in traditional Eggs Benedict sauce, called hollandaise sauce.</p>
        <p> I first heard of eggs benedict when I was trying out a local resturant in my town; <a href="https://www.kekes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Keke's Breakfast Cafe</a>. I knew I had to make my own recipe for this dish. This is a staple breakfast dish at my home and at 348 calories you can eat this everyday as a healthy meal.</p>
