            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In an extra-large stockpot or cast iron skillet, brown ground beef and sausage.</li>
                    <li>Add chopped vegetables, except garlic, and cook until meats are cooked through and vegetables are tender.</li>

                    <li>Add chili powder, tomatoes, tomato paste, and BBQ sauces to the pot, mixing well. Scrape any bits from the bottom of the pot. Cook for about 15 minutes stirring often.</li>

                    <li>Simmer for about 1.5 hours stirring frequently allowing chili flavors to marry. If sauce gets too thick, add water in ¼ cup amounts.</li>
                    <li>Add beans and cook another 30 minutes, stirring frequently. Taste for seasoning and adjust.</li>
                    <li>Serve with garnishes and extras – sour cream, scallions, grated cheese, hot sauce, jalapeños, hot cornbread.</li>
