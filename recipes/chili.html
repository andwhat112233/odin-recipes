        <h2>The Beef and Sausage of this Chili</h2>
        <p>My <strong>Award-Winning</strong> Southern Soul Chili recipe starts with beef and beans in a rich sauce loaded with amazing flavor! That’s perfect for tailgating, game day, or when you’re feeding a crowd. Simmered for hours, it is comfort food at its BEST.</p>
        <p>I first made this chili for a family get-together. I made enough of this chili to feed <strong>over 20 people</strong>! </p>
