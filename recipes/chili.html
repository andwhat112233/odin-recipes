        <h2>The Beef and Potatoes of this Chili</h2>
        <p>My <strong>Award-Winning</strong> Southern Soul Chili recipe starts with beef and beans in a rich sauce loaded with amazing flavor! That’s perfect for tailgating, game day, or when you’re feeding a crowd. Simmered for hours, it is comfort food at its BEST.</p>
        <p>I first made this chili for a family get-together. I made enough of this chili to feed over 20 people. The moment I was scraping the bottom of the large pot, I realized that I needed to make an official recipe and attempt to win a cook-off. </p>
